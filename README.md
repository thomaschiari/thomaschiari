Hi, I'm Thomas.  
I build systems that seek coherence between intelligence, structure, and intent. From agents that reason to tools that last.  
Part of a founding team evolving enterprise financial systems through AI and design.  

Iâ€™m drawn to learning about how things think and why people build:  
- Intelligent agents, context, and memory  
- Product philosophy and the architecture of ideas  
- How reasoning, art, and intent can coexist in what we create
